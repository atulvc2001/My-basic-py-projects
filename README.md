## General info
A compilation of vanilla python projects that you will most likely encounter when you set out to learn python as a beginner. This repository will be constantly updated with more simple projects that will pique my interest. 
EmailSender | A python script that can send Emails using the smtp library.
NumGuesser | A small guessing game where you get three chances to guess a number that's been randomly produced by the random module.
URLshortner | An application used to shorten URLs by using the [bitly.com](https://bitly.com/) as an api
Alarm Clock | An application for alerting you at the desired time and date. I tried to implement the Tkinter module to amplify the user interface experience for the user.
binarySearch | A python script used to find the position of a target value within a sorted array.
diceRolism | A python script to guess a random number between 1 to 6, resembling a dice.
keyLogger | An application that can log in your key strokes into a text file which can be reviewed later.
mediumArticleReader | A webscraper application which is used to extract data from webpages and convert the data into a structured format. I have tried to implement the pyttsx3 module so that the program can read out the text during run time.
randPwdgen | A python script for generating random passwords according to the length the user desires.
weatherApp | An application for webscraping data on weather from the city the user wants to find out about.
